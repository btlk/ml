# ml

## brief

This repo contains my homework assignements during machine learning course taken at NUST MISIS @ spring 2017

## in particular

```
`nn` is my micro deep learning battleground (with ad-hoc Kohonen SOM runner inside)
'clus' is ForEl algo implementation
'gene' is hybrid genetical algo boosted by GD 
'utils' is common facilities library
```

## disclaimer

The projects were written in such a manner, that author is both not shy to present it no third-party AND is not doing rocket science
Thus, do not be surprised to see hacks, ad-hoc design and some anti-patterns (though I tried close to my best to avoid them, until deadlines stroke)

## future plans

Although there is no planned development, this repo is and always be my sandbox for ML algos implementation

Have fun, whoever you are.
